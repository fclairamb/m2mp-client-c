# M2MP C client library

## Introduction 
This is a simple C implementation of M2MP protocol.

## Current status of the project
The project isn't intended to be used by anyone yet. In the future, I'd like it to be integrated in simple embedded hardware.

## How to compile
This should get you started:

    git clone git://github.com/superfc/m2mp-c-client.git
    cd m2mp-c-client/m2mp_client_test/m2mp_client_test_linux
    make

The compilation is handled by netbeans auto-generated Makefile files. This sucks, I'll update it someday.

## The M2MP protocol
Before using this library, you can read the specifications of the [M2MP Protocol](http://florent.clairambault.fr/m2mp-protocol).
